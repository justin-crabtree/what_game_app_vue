      There's an enormous amount of video games to play. The effort to scour the hundreds of games across Steam, Xbox,
      Playstion, and Switch is exhausting for many players. There's a term that describes this reaction called
      "Overchoice", that is a cognitive process in which people have a difficult time making a decision when faced with
      many options. My goal with this site is to ask relevant questions in order to provide a small selection of games
      curated to your interests in hopes that you'll spend more time playing and less time contemplating.

      Questions were designed by me and the game selection was personally curated. Game information was sourced using
      the Internet Game Database API
